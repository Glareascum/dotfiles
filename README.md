# Dotfiles
Personal linux configuration, highly based on tokyonight color scheme. Setup subject to change without any reason depending on how I feel with this configuration. 

Actually the current setup includes:
- **i3** window manager: Small editing from the default configuration;
- **Kitty** as terminal emulator, I just added some themes grabbed from github, current one: nordic by [AlexvZyl](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/nordic.nvim).
- **Picom** with basically the default configuration;
- **Starship** for shell customization, with basically the default configuration, mainly changed the prompt;
- **Polybar** as bar, theme: nordic by [AlexvZyl](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/nordic.nvim);
- **NVim** as text editing engine. Currently highly customized (of course). Current theme: noridic by [AlexvZyl](https://github.com/AlexvZyl/nordic.nvim)

## Nvim
Still learning about Nvim, so I tried to comment at best the various files, I hope to get better at those file in the future (maybe some plugins are not configured at best).
All written in **lua** from scratch as a learning path, lazy as plugin manager used mainly without events.

### Current plugins
- CMP;
- LSPConfig;
- LuaLine;
- Telescope;
- Treesitter;
- Trouble;branches
